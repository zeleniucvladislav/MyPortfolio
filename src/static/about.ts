export const aboutMe = ` I'm web developer from Chisinau, Moldova who loves tech and would like
to help as many people as possible. My main tech focus is
JavaScript/TypeScript and it's UI library named React, with a keen
interest in Node and Vue. I am also passionate to web design
because it helps to understand core concepts of UI/UX experience
that leads to a better application overall. Beside programming I'm
passionate to sports like football, running, cycling and racing.`;
